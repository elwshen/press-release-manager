# Press release manager
This is a simple press release manager. It allows users to sign up as an admin of either publishers or organizations. Admins of publishers can create publishers and view all organizations' press releases. Admins of organizations can create organizations and press releases, each of which is associated with an organization.
I did not get a chance to implement RSPEC tests and polish the UI, so the UI is pretty barebones. I would also have liked to add better navigation between screens, user education (e.g., that an organization admin must create an organization before creating a press release), and form validations (e.g. it breaks when you don't select an organization while creating a press release).
